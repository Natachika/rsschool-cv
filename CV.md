### Summary
My childhood dream was to work with children. Therefore, the first specialty was "Preschool education".
However, while working as a kindergarten teacher, I realized that this was not what I wanted.
Having tried myself in other areas, I came to IT.
Parenting and programming have something in common - by writing code, we control the behavior of an element on the page, 
just as by laying down certain knowledge to a child, we direct him to a certain behavior in society.
My main goal now is to comprehensively study programming and improve myself as a programmer. In the foreseeable future, 
I want to join a friendly team and develop significant projects that benefit a civilized society.
